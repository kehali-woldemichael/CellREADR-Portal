<p>CellREADR stands for Cell access through RNA sensing by Endogenous ADAR (adenosine deaminase acting on RNA),
and represents a new generation of RNA-based cell monitoring and manipulation technology. 
CellREADR is implemented as a modular RNA molecule that can detect the presence of a cellular RNA and then trigger the translation of a desired effector protein 
Effector translation is mediated by RNA editing, catalyzed by a cell endogenous enzyme (ADAR) ubiquitous to all metazoan cells.
